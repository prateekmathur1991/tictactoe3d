Tic Tac Toe 3D
==================

The Tic Tac Toe 3D Project allows users to play the very popular game Tic Tac Toe in 3D.
It uses Google App Engine as its backend, and HTML5/CSS3/jQuery to create the front-end. Maven has been used as the build system.

Currently the game is available only in 2D, but the 3D update will roll out soon!!
The game will feature a cool 3D UI, and will also support saving the game performance of a player in cloud.
A mobile version of the same game is also being planned.
