Updates made to tictactoe3D Project

29 August 2014 
-> Updated and changed the API Key in setApiKey() method, and also added the API root in gapi.client.load() method. This removed the 'UnCaught TypeError' on localhost, but not on appspot.
   (The JS console flashes the error 'Failed to load resource: The server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found).
   
-> Changed the web.xml file to include the CONFIDENTIAL user-data-constraint. This did not remove the 'Uncaught TypeError' on appspot.
   (But this time, the JS console flashes the error 'Failed to load resource: The server responded with a status of 403 (Forbidden). On clicking
   on the error message, a JSON object is returned looks something like this-
   {"error":{"errors":[{"domain":"global","reason":"sslRequired","message":"SSL is required to perform this operation."}],"code":403,"message":"SSL is required to perform this operation."}}
   (Looks like our app needs SSL!!!)
   
-> Perform update operation. Uploaded the app on appspot. And found out that the error was removed, and there was no 'Failed to load resource error'.
   
-> A new error has been introduced in the app. This error exists both on appspot as well as localhost.
   This error is most probably related to JSON parsing. After clicking on any square, the server returns a JSON object, which looks like this-
   {code: 400, message: "com.google.appengine.repackaged.org.codehaus.jacks…nce chain: com.tictactoe3d.game.MinimaxBoard["state"])", data: Array[1], error: Object}
   
   The full error message is-
   om.google.appengine.repackaged.org.codehaus.jackson.map.JsonMappingException: Can not deserialize instance of java.lang.String out of START_ARRAY token↵ at [Source: N/A; line: -1, column: -1] (through reference chain: com.tictactoe3d.game.MinimaxBoard["state"])"
__proto__: Object

31 August 2014
-> Made a temporary change to the code of render.js, and called tictactoe2D.simpleMethod() instead of compute2DMove(). On executing it, the server returned a JSON object
   with the state as one of its key-value pair. This intensifies the doubt that call to compute2DMove() is failing probably because of the JS array
   passed as an argument instead of a string, which is expected by compute2DMove().
   
-> Added a Board2D argument to simpleMethod() and called it with the same JSON object as an argument, and saw the same error in the console. This CONFIRMS
   that a JS array being sent to the method is causing it and compute2DMove() to fail.
   
-> Changed the code of render.js to use the .join() method of JavaScript to convert the board array into a string. This fixed the JsonMappingException
   that plagued the app. And the server responded with the the proper state variable, which can also be seen in the console.
   
2 September 2014
-> Made major changes to render.js. Created separate helper functions for parsing the board string and handling the click event of the squares. And
   added functionality to call the compute2DMove() function inside the click event handler.
   
3 September 2014
-> Added the checkForVictory() function in render.js. Earlier decided to create it as an endpoint method, but that idea was dropped.
   So, created the function with some 'inspiration' from the google sample project, and executed it. The function seems to work almost fine,
   but has a bug. It is actually showing a victory position as a TIE, and that is a bug. Will now debug it.
   
-> The game is up and running, and fully functional too!! The latest version has been uploaded on appspot, and very soon we can start uploading
   its own github repository, and get a GNU GPL license for it too....
   
-> A new bug has been discovered.
   The game is able to detect the victory of the user, but not of the computer. Even when there are 3 Os in a single row, coloumn, or a diagonal,
   the game simply does nothing. To fix this, we most probably need to make changes in the checkForVictory() function, and also call its once more
   when the board is updated.
   
-> Changed the values of the status variables WON, LOST, TIE, and UNFINSHED. And also used the logical OR instead of logical AND operator in
   checkForVictory() method. This fixed the previous bug of not detecting the computer's victory. The game is now FULLY FUNCTIONAL!!, and can be
   used....
   
4 September 2014
-> Decided to get a GNU GPL license for the project. Added the license information in all source files, and also included the LICENSE.txt in the
   root folder of the project.

4 November 2014
-> An implementation for the minimax algorithm was added in the game. The implementation got finished after 1.5 months after
   several code re-writes.
   
-> But then, the code broke due to a JsonMappingException, as I had converted the Board class to contain some other fields
   other than state. This led to the class not being a POJO, which Jackson excepts.

-> Restored the Board class to be a POJO, and created another MinimaxBoard class for implementation purposes. But this led to a super strange bug
   in the code. The response form the server does not contain an 'O' at the desired position, but at EACH AND EVERY empty position in the board.
   The code needs to be debugged again throughly, which I, frankly speaking, don't have the time to do.

-> (P.S. Please forgive me for not updating the changelog more often.)
